# define a default to use
default: float8_e5m2

mods:
  - layers: 0-56
    cast:   bfloat16



#  - layers: 0-56
#    blocks: img
#    cast:   bfloat16

# layers is x or x-y. Required.
# blocks is a simple string match. 

# In layers 0-18, the blocks are named [txt|img]_[mod|attn|mlp], so '_' matches everything. If missing, it is '_'
# In lauers 19-56, the blocks are named linear1, linear2, modulation
# cast can be to bfloat16, float8_e4m3fn, float8_e5m2, none, or default. If missing, it's 'default'
#
# Looks like mod and mlp need to be the same
