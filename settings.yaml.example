# Define how layers should be (a) pruned, (b) cast, and (c) trained
#
# In each entry, `layers` defines the layers to which this rule applies. It can be:
# - an int
# - a range (inclusive) x-y
# - a comma separated list of int or ranges
# - 'all', 'double', or 'single'
# 
# In all sections, `blocks` an optional  restriction of the blocks that are matched.
# For pruning, blocks only applies for double layers (0-18), and can be 'img' or 'txt'.
# For casting and training, blocks is a simple text match to the full name of the block.
# Training only works on img_mlp and/or txp_mlp in double blocks, or linear1 and linear2 in single blocks
#
# 'none' can be used to turn this off, 'all' for all blocks
#
# In pruning, there is an additional required parameter, 
# `remove` defines the number of lines to be removed.
#
# In casting, there is an additional optional parameter,
# `castto` which can be:
# a torch dtype: float8_e4m3fn, float8_e4m3fnuz, float8_e5m2, flopat8_e5m2uz
# a bitsandbytes Linear replacement: Linear8bitLt, Linear4bit (==LinearFP4), LinearNF4
# a support gguf type, Q8_0, Q5_1, Q4_1
# 'none' (do not cast), or `default` (use the value defined in `--default_cast` in the arguments)
