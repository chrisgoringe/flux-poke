impact of nothing? there seems to be 6.432?


does impact add? if not is there a pattern? try two layers and compare img+img to img+txt
(independent errors add the square)

plot impact per bit saved
also time cost per bit saved

do whole stack to get time cost

seperate sub-bits (ff, attn, norm etc.) on whole stack

bias / weight  separately (start with whole stack)



bfloat8 casts
