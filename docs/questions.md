autocast and txt in layer 18? gives infs - maybe it's autocast including the stack?

seperate sub-bits (ff, attn, norm etc.)

does impact add? if not is there a pattern? try two layers and compare img+img to img+txt
(independent errors add the square)


bnb4 bnb8 bfloat8 casts  ALL RUBBISH


do whole stack to get time cost


bias / weight  separately (start with whole stack)
